Add a short crowd cheer or chant audio file here for better stadium/celebration sound.

Optional file (recommended):
  crowd-cheer.mp3   (or .ogg) - 1-3 seconds of crowd cheering/chanting

Place your file in this folder. Use royalty-free clips from e.g. Freesound.org (CC0),
Pixabay, or similar. The app will play it (layered 2-3 times for a thicker sound) when
6-7/7-6 or 10+ scores are recorded, and for the 3-second loopable stadium cheer.

If the file is missing, the app still works: it uses a generated crowd-like noise
for the stadium cheer and iconic score celebrations. Adding crowd-cheer.mp3
improves the sound.
